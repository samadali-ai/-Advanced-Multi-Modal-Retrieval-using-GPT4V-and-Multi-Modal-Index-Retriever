### Advanced Multi-Modal Retrieval System

This project demonstrates how to build an advanced multi-modal retrieval system that combines text and image data using technologies like LlamaIndex, GPT-4V, and CLIP. The system is designed to enhance user queries by retrieving relevant information from both text and images, providing a richer context and comprehensive answers.

#### Overview

The retrieval system aims to utilize state-of-the-art models to analyze and synthesize information. By leveraging natural language processing and computer vision, it offers an integrated approach to information retrieval, allowing users to explore complex datasets easily.

#### Key Features

1. **Text and Image Indexing**: The system employs LlamaIndex to create a multi-modal index that allows for efficient searching and retrieval of both text and image data.
   
2. **Image Reasoning**: It uses the GPT-4V model to generate descriptive captions for images, helping the system understand the content and context of visual information.

3. **Multi-Modal Retrieval**: Users can query the system to retrieve relevant text and images simultaneously, resulting in more informative and context-aware responses.

#### Requirements

To run the project, you'll need:
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- A series of libraries such as LlamaIndex, CLIP, PyTorch, and others, which can be installed via pip.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files from the repository.
   
2. **Configure OpenAI API**: Insert your OpenAI API key into the code where required.

3. **Data Collection**: Download images, text data from Wikipedia, and SEC filings. This data serves as the foundation for indexing and retrieval.

#### Workflow

The workflow of the system consists of four main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather images and text from various sources like Tesla's website and Wikipedia articles related to electric vehicles. The data includes specifications, performance metrics, and visual content.

2. **Image Analysis**: Use GPT-4V to analyze the downloaded images. This involves generating alternative text or descriptions that capture the essence of the visual data.

3. **Index Creation**: Build a multi-modal index using the LlamaIndex framework. This involves storing the collected text and images in a vector store (Qdrant) to facilitate efficient searching.

4. **Querying**: Implement querying capabilities where users can input specific questions or prompts. The system retrieves relevant data from the indexed content, providing both text and images in the response.

#### Usage

- **Image Reasoning**: Users can submit images, and the system will return descriptive captions that summarize the visual content.
  
- **Multi-Modal Retrieval**: Users can ask questions about electric vehicles or related topics. The system retrieves pertinent information from the text and relevant images, allowing for a richer understanding of the topic.

#### Contributions

The project welcomes contributions. Users are encouraged to submit pull requests or report issues to improve the system.
